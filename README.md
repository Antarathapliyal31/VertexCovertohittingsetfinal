Vertex Cover to Hitting Set Converter

This project provides a Python-based tool to convert a **Vertex Cover** problem into an equivalent **Hitting Set** problem. It's designed for educational purposes, theoretical computer science, and demonstrating problem reductions.

What It Does
Given:
- An undirected graph (as an edge list)
- A vertex cover size k

The tool:
- Creates a universe of edges
- Maps each vertex to a subset of edges it touches
- Outputs a Hitting Set problem instance in JSON format
